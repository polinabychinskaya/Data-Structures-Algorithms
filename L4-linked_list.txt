If you want to insert a value in an array (.insert(1, value)) (dynamic list), 
then within the list all the values below ‘1’ have to be copied and go down. 
However, if you reached the initial memory capacity, then it adds some space 
(previous capacity + previous capacity *2), copies all the elements and inserts 
the new value. Time complexity is O(n). And this is not efficient. Instead try a 
linked list (линейный список), it has nodes (узлы), which contain a piece of data 
and a link to the next node. The last node’s link is Null. Now you do not have 
to copy all the elements, But you have to change the link of the previous node 
and assign value and the link to the next one. In doubly linked list, 
you have a link to your previous element as well.
