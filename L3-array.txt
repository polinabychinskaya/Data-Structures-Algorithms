In python, a list is implemented as a dynamic array. 
In other languages like Java, C++ we have static and dynamic arrays both. 
In static arrays, when the size is fixed, you cannot insert any other value. 
In a dynamic array, you do not have to specify the size. It will not preserve 
the limited amount of space but the ‘initial capacity’ (striped) and free space 
can be used by other programs (gray area). If the number of allowed values exceeds, 
it allocates more additional capacity of memory (the initial size * by 2) and 
copies the previous elements to a new object. It works like a mathematical progression.
