# Linear search
To find a value you have to iterate through the collection 
and compare to the value you are looking for
So the time complexity is O(n)

# Binary search
-- the list is sorted
-- you split the list and find the median
-- you compare with the searched value, if it's bigger than the median 
than we move to the right and vice versa, so kth iteration = n/(2^k)
log2 n = log2 2^k
log2 n = klog2 2
log2 n = k
Search complexity is O(log2 n)
