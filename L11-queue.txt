Producer - consumer problem 
                                    Queue
            ----------------------------------------------------
Producer --> Stock 1 (11:00, 131.10$) | Stock 1 (11:01, 132.30$) --> Consumer
            ----------------------------------------------------
The producer-consumer problem is a classic synchronization problem 
in computer science. It involves coordinating the actions of two 
processes, a producer and a consumer, that share a common buffer 
or queue. The producer is responsible for producing items and 
placing them into the buffer, while the consumer consumes 
these items from the buffer.

If we send data (exchange rate) directly for instance 
from a stock exchange to a bank and if a server of a reciever breaks 
and the data is sent, when the server is down, some pieces of 
that period might be lost. To prevent it, we can use a queue as an intermediary.

The queue is based on FIFO (first in, first out)
