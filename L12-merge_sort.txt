Imagine you have 2 sorted arrays and you want to merge 
them in one list
And you take the first values of both lists and compare them 
Then you move forward comparing 
the elemnts and placing them in ascending order

What if you have an unordered list like this, then you split it and merge

            [3 2 1 4]
                |
        [3 2]       [1 4]
          |           | 
    [3]     [2]   [1]    [4]
          |           |
         [2 3]       [1 4]
                |
            [1 2 3 4]

Time complexity nlogn

In python .sort() uses merge and insert sort
